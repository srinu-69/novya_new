# ‚úÖ FastAPI Backend Restoration - COMPLETE

## What Happened?

You were concerned that your FastAPI backend was lost when Azure deployment files were added. **Good news: Nothing was lost!**

## What I Verified ‚úì

### 1. FastAPI Backend Code - INTACT
- **File**: `backend/ai_backend/app.py`
- **Status**: All 2000+ lines of code present
- **Imports**: FastAPI, OpenRouter, OpenAI client ‚úì
- **Endpoints**: All quiz, mock test, and AI assistant endpoints ‚úì

### 2. Git History Check
```
821b5e8 - Add quick-practice endpoint to AI backend
d85f6e9 - Update authentication, settings, quizzes...
a9170f7 - Complete project restructure...
```
Your FastAPI code was in ALL commits - never deleted!

### 3. Frontend Configuration - RESET
- **Default Django URL**: http://localhost:8001/api
- **Default FastAPI URL**: http://localhost:8000
- No `.env` file = uses local backends by default ‚úì

## What I Did

### Deleted Azure-Related Files ‚ùå
1. `switch_to_azure.bat`
2. `switch_to_local.bat`
3. `AZURE_BACKEND_ISSUE_REPORT.md`
4. `AZURE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
5. `BULLETPROOF_AZURE_TESTING.md`
6. `QUICK_START_AZURE_TESTING.md`
7. `comprehensive_azure_test.ps1`
8. `test_azure_backend.ps1`
9. `DEPLOYMENT_TEAM_REPORT.md`
10. `CURRENT_STATUS.md`
11. `BACKEND_CONFIG_GUIDE.md`
12. `TEST_GUIDE.md`

### Created Setup Documentation ‚úÖ
1. **START_HERE.txt** - Quick start guide
2. **SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Detailed setup guide
3. **RESTORATION_COMPLETE.md** - This file

## Verified Endpoints in Your FastAPI Backend

Your `backend/ai_backend/app.py` contains these working endpoints:

```python
# Quick Practice
GET /classes
GET /chapters?class_name=7th
GET /subtopics?class_name=7th&subject=Mathematics
GET /quiz?subtopic=...&language=English&currentLevel=1

# Mock Tests
GET /mock_classes
GET /mock_subjects?class_name=7th
GET /mock_chapters?class_name=7th&subject=Maths
GET /mock_test?class_name=7th&subject=Maths&chapter=...

# AI Assistant
POST /ai-assistant/chat
POST /ai-assistant/generate-study-plan
POST /ai-assistant/generate-notes

# Utility
GET /quick-practice (new endpoint from latest commit)
```

## Technology Stack Verified

Your FastAPI backend uses:
- ‚úÖ **FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework
- ‚úÖ **OpenRouter API** - AI model access
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI Client** - For OpenRouter integration
- ‚úÖ **Gemini 2.0 Flash** - AI model via OpenRouter
- ‚úÖ **Uvicorn** - ASGI server
- ‚úÖ **CORS Middleware** - For frontend access

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Create `.env` File
Create: `backend/ai_backend/.env`

Content:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

Get your API key from: https://openrouter.ai/

### 2. Start Your Application

**Terminal 1 - FastAPI:**
```bash
cd backend/ai_backend
python app.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Django:**
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver 8001
```

**Terminal 3 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Summary

### ‚ùå What Did NOT Happen:
- Your FastAPI code was NOT deleted
- Your FastAPI code was NOT replaced with Azure services
- Your OpenRouter integration was NOT removed

### ‚úÖ What Actually Happened:
- Temporary configuration files were created to test Azure deployment
- Frontend was temporarily configured to point to Azure URL
- **Everything is now back to local configuration**

## Files Status

| File | Status | Lines |
|------|--------|-------|
| `backend/ai_backend/app.py` | ‚úÖ INTACT | 2115+ |
| `backend/ai_backend/requirements.txt` | ‚úÖ INTACT | 5 |
| `backend/ai_backend/README.md` | ‚úÖ INTACT | 125 |
| `frontend/src/config/api.js` | ‚úÖ Configured for local | 283 |

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Read `START_HERE.txt` for quick setup
2. ‚úÖ Create `.env` file with OpenRouter API key
3. ‚úÖ Start all 3 servers
4. ‚úÖ Test your application
