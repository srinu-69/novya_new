# 🎉 500 ERROR FIXED - QUIZ SUBMISSION WORKING!

## ✅ **PROBLEM RESOLVED SUCCESSFULLY**

### 🐛 **Root Cause of 500 Error:**
The 500 Internal Server Error was caused by the `update_student_performance` function trying to use an `AnonymousUser` object in a database query that expected a `User` instance.

**Error Details:**
```
TypeError: Field 'userid' expected a number but got <django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser object>
ValueError: Cannot query "Test Update From Frontend": Must be "User" instance.
```

### 🔧 **Solution Applied:**

1. **Fixed `get_student_registration` function** to properly handle `AnonymousUser` objects
2. **Modified `update_student_performance` call** to pass `student_reg` instead of `request.user`
3. **Disabled performance updates** for anonymous users (testing mode)

### 📊 **Verification Results:**

#### **✅ Quiz Submission Status:**
- **HTTP Status**: 201 (Created - Success)
