# Parent Details Fix Summary

## Issue
The user profile page was showing "Not provided" for all parent details even when parent information was available in the database. Additionally, there was a 500 error when trying to access the profile endpoint due to a missing database table.

## Root Cause
1. **Database Error**: The `get_user_profile` function was trying to access `user.student` and `user.parent` which referenced non-existent models/tables in the database.
2. **Missing Parent Data**: The profile endpoint wasn't automatically fetching parent details from the linked parent registration.

## Solution

### Fixed Database Error
- **Problem**: `user.student` and `user.parent` were trying to access non-existent database tables
- **Solution**: Updated the `get_user_profile` function to use the correct models:
  - `StudentRegistration` instead of `user.student`
  - `ParentRegistration` instead of `user.parent`
  - `StudentProfile` for additional student information

### Fixed Parent Details Loading
- **Problem**: Parent details weren't being automatically fetched from the database
- **Solution**: Added logic to automatically fetch parent details when a student is logged in:
  1. Get the student's `parent_email` from `StudentRegistration`
  2. Use that email to look up the parent in `ParentRegistration`
  3. Return complete parent details (name, email, phone) in the API response

## Code Changes

### Backend (`backend/authentication/views.py`)
- **Lines 192-270**: Completely rewrote the `get_user_profile` function to:
  - Use correct database models (`StudentRegistration`, `ParentRegistration`, `StudentProfile`)
  - Automatically fetch parent details for students
  - Handle cases where parent doesn't exist gracefully
  - Return structured data with all necessary information

### Key Features Added:
1. **Automatic Parent Lookup**: When a student logs in, the system automatically finds their linked parent
2. **Complete Data Structure**: Returns student registration, student profile, and parent details
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing data with appropriate fallbacks
4. **Database Safety**: Uses existing, correct database tables

## API Response Structure
The profile endpoint now returns:
```json
{
  "user": { /* basic user info */ },
  "student_registration": { /* student registration data */ },
  "student_profile": { /* additional student profile data */ },
  "parent_details": { /* automatically fetched parent information */ }
}
```

## Testing
- ✅ Database error resolved - no more 500 errors
- ✅ Parent details automatically populate from linked parent registration
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- ✅ No UI changes required - all fixes are backend improvements

## Impact
- **Before**: Parent details showed "Not provided" and 500 errors occurred
- **After**: Parent details automatically load from the database and display correctly
- **User Experience**: Seamless - no changes needed on the frontend
- **Data Integrity**: Uses correct database relationships and models
