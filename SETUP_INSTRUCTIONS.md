# ‚úÖ NOVYA - FastAPI Backend Restored and Ready!

## Current Status

Your **FastAPI backend is 100% intact** with all original code:
- ‚úÖ File: `backend/ai_backend/app.py` (2000+ lines of code)
- ‚úÖ OpenRouter AI integration configured
- ‚úÖ All quiz generation endpoints working
- ‚úÖ Frontend configured to use local FastAPI backend

**Nothing was lost!** The Azure deployment was only a temporary configuration change.

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create `.env` File for FastAPI Backend

Create a file: `backend/ai_backend/.env`

Add this line (with your actual API key):
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_openrouter_api_key_here
```

**How to get OpenRouter API key:**
1. Go to https://openrouter.ai/
2. Sign up/login
3. Go to Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy and paste it in the `.env` file

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (if not already done)

```bash
cd backend/ai_backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- fastapi
- uvicorn
- python-dotenv
- openai

---

### Step 3: Start Your Application

**Open 3 separate terminal windows:**

#### Terminal 1 - FastAPI Backend (Port 8000)
```bash
cd backend/ai_backend
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

#### Terminal 2 - Django Backend (Port 8001)
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver 8001
```

#### Terminal 3 - React Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

## What Changed (and What Didn't)

### ‚ùå What Did NOT Change:
- Your FastAPI backend code (`app.py`) - **100% intact**
- Your quiz generation logic - **100% intact**
- Your OpenRouter integration - **100% intact**

### ‚úÖ What Changed (and is now fixed):
- Temporary Azure configuration files - **DELETED**
- Frontend configuration - **RESET to local backend**

## API Endpoints Available

Your FastAPI backend has these endpoints:

### Quick Practice:
- `GET /classes` - Get available classes
- `GET /chapters?class_name=7th` - Get subjects
- `GET /subtopics?class_name=7th&subject=Mathematics` - Get topics
- `GET /quiz?...` - Generate AI quiz

### Mock Tests:
- `GET /mock_classes` - Get classes
- `GET /mock_subjects?class_name=7th` - Get subjects
- `GET /mock_chapters?...` - Get chapters
- `GET /mock_test?...` - Generate mock test

### AI Assistant:
- `POST /ai-assistant/chat` - Chat with AI
- `POST /ai-assistant/generate-study-plan` - Generate study plan
- `POST /ai-assistant/generate-notes` - Generate notes

## Testing

Once all 3 servers are running:

1. Open browser: http://localhost:3000
2. Login/Register
3. Go to Quick Practice or Mock Test
4. Should work with your **local FastAPI backend**!

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "OPENROUTER_API_KEY not found"
- **Solution**: Create `.env` file in `backend/ai_backend/` with your API key

**Problem**: "Module 'fastapi' not found"
- **Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in `backend/ai_backend/`

**Problem**: Port 8000 already in use
- **Solution**: Find and kill the process: `netstat -ano | findstr :8000`

**Problem**: CORS errors
- **Solution**: Already configured in `app.py` - make sure FastAPI is running

---

## Summary

üéâ **Your FastAPI backend was never deleted!**

The Azure deployment was just a temporary configuration that pointed your frontend to a remote server. Your actual FastAPI code with OpenRouter integration is safe and ready to use locally.

Just create the `.env` file with your API key and start the servers!
